With this application you can easily draw graphs and save them as image or as text data.


The base of every graph is a vertex.
You can create a vertex in the center of the board by clicking the button saying "add vertex". Alternatively you can select "create on click" option to start creating a new vertex each time you click on an empty space on the board.

Each pair of vertices can be joined by an edge.
To create an edge between vertices select at least one vertex and click on another, unselected one.


Click on an unselected vertex to select it.
While holding the shift key, you can unselect the selected vertices, by clicking on them.
Click on the empty space and drag to enable selection zone. Vertices withing selection zone will be selected.
